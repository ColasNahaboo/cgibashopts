# the web server, and form-files/$B.vars is the dump of the environment vars
# the uploaded files sources are in files-unix for the browsers under unix
# and files-dos for the browsers under windows, as captured by 
# cgibashopts-form-files.cgi in /tmp/CBOgen-$B.data and /tmp/CBOgen-$B.vars

# We "replay" all the saved CGI invocation data in form, so we do not 
# need a web server, different browsers, and manual steps for the tests
